Welcome to a glimpse into my world

## Introduction
* This site is a home base for all the current happenings in my life. I am an undergraduate CompEng student with an interests in pure math and computer architecture. I believe hard work pays off, and that probably sums up most of my life goals/ambitions/enjoyment. Thanks for stopping by!
